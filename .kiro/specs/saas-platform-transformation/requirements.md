# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing microtravel experience sharing platform into a comprehensive SaaS application. The transformation includes redesigning the landing page and dashboard for responsive design, implementing robust authentication management, creating a complete SaaS subscription flow with Stripe integration, establishing secure routing throughout the application, and filling in missing pages to create a complete user experience. The goal is to create a professional, scalable platform that can monetize microtravel content sharing while maintaining the core mission of authentic travel experience documentation.
